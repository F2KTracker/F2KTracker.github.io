        Discord Inc. is neither connected to, nor does it support, the Bot. The
        existence of any direct association with Discord or any of its

        property.
      </p>
      <h2 id="liability">Liability</h2>
      <p>
        We retain the right to change these Terms and Policies at any time. You
        can opt out of these Terms and Policies by removing the bot from any
        server for which you have authorization and not utilising its
        capabilities.
      </p>
      <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
      <p>
        People can contact the Bot through its official

      <h2>Usage of Data</h2>
      <p>
        The bot may utilise stored data, as stated below, for a variety of
        purposes, including but not limited to:
        <strong
          >sending messages to certain channels, mentioning a role and command
          processing</strong
        >. Data will not be used for purposes other than those listed above, and
        it will not be shared with any third-party site or service.
      </p>
      <h2 id="stored-info">Stored Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Guild id</strong>- with the value being the Server's ID.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Channel id</strong>- used to deliver a message to a certain
          channel.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Role id</strong>- used for mentioning a certain role.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Further than the information stated above, no further data will be kept.
      </p>
      <h2>Updating Data</h2>
      <p>
        When a certain bot command is used, the data may be updated. A user's
        interaction is needed for these data changes.
      </p>
      <h2>Temporarely stored Information</h2>
      <p>
        For a certain period of time, the Bot may retain the stored data in an
        internal caching mechanism to minimise database queries. Cache data will
        be deleted after a predetermined amount of time and re-acquired just as
        needed. Premature data dropping from cache can occur from things like
        removing the bot from the server.
      </p>
      <h2>Removal of Data</h2>
      <h4>Automatic removal</h4>
      <p>
        Bot removal from a server allows for the automated removal of stored
        data. Discord's moderating capabilities may be used to do this.
        Re-adding the bot to the server will cause data to be stored once more,
        as outlined in this policy's section on
        <a href="#stored-info">stored information</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>Manual removal</h4>
      <p>
        A specific command of the bot can be used to remove data.For certain
        data to be deleted, user input is required.
